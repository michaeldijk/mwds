# MWDS - My WebDev Story
## Milestone #3 study project

[Visit the site on Heroku - MWDS](http://mwds.herokuapp.com/)

This site is created as Milestone #3 project for Code Institute, showcasing my progress in becoming a confident front/backend (full stack) developer.
MWDS is, a site / community, where others can leave their story, in web development. And, this story is then shared among the community of other users, that use the site.
It is also a place where users can just share snippets, of certain things, or, code. Or, just post general information to others.

### Who is the website for?
The audience is geared towards developers, creators, coders, and anyone who feel like sharing stories, coding techniques, and handy knowhows.

### Who is the Owner?
Michael Dijk, is the site's owner and developer.

Michael's aim with this site was first and foremost, to show the ability to create a site with CRUD functionality. And secondly, to create a community where users can share their stories, and align with other people of same interest.
The idea was brought to live, as Michael, enjoys using the site Quora, and some of it's features are designed and created as an hommage to this site.

Michael's goals where:
* Showcasing the skills to build a front/backend project.
* Showcasing the use of MongoDB
* Showcasing the use of Flask
* Building full CRUD functionality
* Creating a place for an online community

### UX Planes
The following parts, describe the different planes and how I incorporated them into my project

#### Strategy Plane
The audience is geared towards developers, creators, coders, and anyone who feel like sharing stories, coding techniques, and handy knowhows. 
We're making a site for people to share their story, and be able to read other stories, search by tags, and or the story itself.
The site allows users to share excitement regarding coding, to the world, and the community MWDS is.
For users, they can expect an audience reading their content, their solutions to problems, and, being able to be part of a “community” of like-minded people.
